<p align="center">
This repository is a collection of my real-world phishing email investigations and write-ups.  
Each project includes step-by-step analysis, extracted Indicators of Compromise (IOCs),  
and screenshots that document the investigation process.

<p> Email samples used are included in each project repository and were gotten from Phishing_Pot Github here âž¡âž¡https://github.com/rf-peixoto/phishing_pot/tree/main </p>
