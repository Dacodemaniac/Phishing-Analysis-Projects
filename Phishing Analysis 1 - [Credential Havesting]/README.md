## üõ†Ô∏è Thought Process
Explain **how you approached the analysis** step by step, and why.  
Example:
- **Step 1:** I opened the email with outlook as the MUA and checked the body of the email. I did this to get the context of the whole attack and also know how to begin my investigation. It was obvious at first glance that the email is indeed a malicious one since the attacker who masqueraded as Mary (an employee at att.net)  was the sender on behalf of Binance. This seemed suspicious.

  </p>
  
    There was also a sense of urgency to get the users to Update their leaked PII and get compensated with bitcoin when done. Urgency is one of the social engineering techniques used by threat actors.

</p>

  I also checked for attachments but found  none, only to notice the entire image was embedded as the link to the malicious     domain when hovered over. This also seemed like a red flag as unsuspecting users could easily fall for this trick thinking it  was a normal image.

  
- **Step 2:** I then proceeded to obtain the raw email and trace the origin of the email and the routes taken before it got to the recepient.

  The email shown to have originated from a city in Russia while the server involved in this phsihing campaign was from USA.

  </p>
  I decided to check both IPs on VirusTotal and shockingly both came out as clean.

  </p>
   </p>
   <p align="center">
  <img src="./Images/Phishing sample 22.jpg" alt="Email Header Screenshot" width="80%">
  </p>
- **Step 3:** Even if the IPs and the domain appeared clean, it still doesn't make the email a legit one. The next thing i did was compare the Reply-To, From, and Return-Path headers to see if they match, and surprisingly they did match.

  </p>
   </p>
   <p align="center">
  <img src="./Images/Phishing sample 24.jpg" alt="Email Header Screenshot" width="80%">
  </p>
 
   This still doesn't prove the email is a legit one as previous signs have indicated the email address was indeed spoofed, but to confirm this I had to look at the Authenticated-Results header for email authentication protocols like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.
  <p align="center">
  <img src="./Images/Phishing sample 17.jpg" alt="Email Header Screenshot" width="80%">
  </p>
- **Step 4:** Opened URL in a safe sandbox and captured network traffic for IOC extraction.
- **Step 5:** Documented findings and compared with known phishing techniques.

You can also embed small screenshots inline with explanations.
